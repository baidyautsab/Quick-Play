# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Play the timeless strategy game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3√ó3 grid to achieve three in a row!

## üéÆ Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

### How to Play

1. **Two Player Game:** Player X always goes first, followed by Player O
2. **Make Your Move:** Click on any empty cell in the 3√ó3 grid
3. **Winning Conditions:** Get three of your symbols in a row:
   - **Horizontally:** Three across any row
   - **Vertically:** Three down any column  
   - **Diagonally:** Three across either diagonal line
4. **Game End:** Game ends when someone wins or all 9 cells are filled (draw)
5. **Start Over:** Click "Reset Game" to play again

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure with data attributes
- **CSS3:** Modern styling with grid layout and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Pure JavaScript without frameworks or libraries
- **DOM Manipulation:** Real-time updates and event handling

### Game Architecture

#### Data Structure
```javascript
// Game state represented as a 9-element array
gameBoard = ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']
// Maps to grid positions:
// [0][1][2]
// [3][4][5] 
// [6][7][8]
```

#### Core Components

**Game State Management:**
- `currentPlayer`: Tracks active player ('X' or 'O')
- `gameBoard`: Array representing the 3√ó3 grid state
- `gameActive`: Boolean flag controlling game flow

**Win Detection Algorithm:**
- Static array of all 8 possible winning combinations
- Uses `Array.some()` and `Array.every()` for efficient checking
- Checks after each move for immediate win detection

**Event Handling:**
- Click listeners on all grid cells
- Data attribute mapping for position identification
- Move validation before processing

## üéØ Game Logic Details

### Winning Combinations
The game recognizes 8 possible winning patterns:

| Type | Combinations | Grid Positions |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Rows** | 3 horizontal lines | [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8] |
| **Columns** | 3 vertical lines | [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8] |
| **Diagonals** | 2 diagonal lines | [0,4,8], [2,4,6] |

### Game Flow
1. **Initialization:** Player X starts, empty board, game active
2. **Move Validation:** Check if cell is empty and game is active
3. **Move Execution:** Update board state and display
4. **Win Check:** Evaluate if current move creates winning pattern
5. **Draw Check:** Verify if board is full without winner
6. **Turn Switch:** Alternate between X and O players
7. **Game End:** Display result and disable further moves

### Move Validation Rules
- Cell must be empty (contains empty string)
- Game must be active (not ended)
- Only one move per cell allowed
- No moves allowed after game ends
