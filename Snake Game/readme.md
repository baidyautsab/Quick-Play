## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For game rendering and graphics
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core game logic and functionality
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **GSAP 3.12.5**: Animation library for smooth visual effects

### Game Architecture

The game is built using an object-oriented approach with a single `SnakeGame` class that handles:

- **Game State Management**: Snake position, food generation, scoring
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard and touch controls
- **Collision Detection**: Wall and self-collision detection
- **Rendering**: Canvas drawing and animations
- **Game Loop**: Continuous update and draw cycles

### Key Features Implementation

#### Grid-Based Movement
- 20x20 grid system (400px canvas with 20px grid cells)
- Snake and food positions stored as grid coordinates
- Smooth pixel-perfect movement

#### Speed Progression
- Initial speed: 150ms per frame (~6.7 FPS)
- Speed increases by 5ms every time food is eaten
- Minimum speed cap: 50ms per frame (~20 FPS)

#### Collision System
- **Wall Collision**: Detects when snake head goes beyond canvas boundaries
- **Self Collision**: Prevents snake from colliding with its own body segments
- **Food Collision**: Triggers scoring and snake growth
